# Week 7 – Streamlit Model Deployment

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to **deploy a trained machine learning model** using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The web application allows users to input custom data, receive predictions in real time, and understand the model outputs through clean and interactive visualizations.

## 📦 Features

- Simple and intuitive UI for user input
- Real-time predictions based on a trained ML model
- Visual feedback to help users interpret model output
- Deployed using Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- Model: `Logistic Regression` / `RandomForest` / (replace with your model)
- Dataset: (Mention dataset used — e.g. Iris, Titanic, House Prices)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV (if applied)
