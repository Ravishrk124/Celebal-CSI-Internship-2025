# 📘 Week 5 – Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering 🧹

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains the code and resources for **Week 5** of the Celebal Summer Internship 2025. The objective was to perform comprehensive **data preprocessing** and apply **feature engineering techniques** on a real-world regression dataset to make it ready for modeling.

The dataset used is the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** from Kaggle.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling (Standardization & Normalization)  
- Detecting and handling outliers  
- Feature transformation (log, square root)  
- Creating new features (e.g., TotalBathrooms, Age of House)  
- Dropping irrelevant/redundant features  
- Visualizing pre- vs post-processed data

---

## 🧪 Assignment Tasks

- Load the training dataset (`train.csv`)
- Inspect null values and handle them appropriately
- Encode categorical features using:
  - Label Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding
- Detect and address skewed distributions
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Create and engineer new meaningful features
- Remove features with low variance or high missing rate
- Prepare the dataset for modeling
