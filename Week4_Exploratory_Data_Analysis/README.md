# 📘 Week 4 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains the in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted as part of Week 4 of the Celebal Summer Internship 2025. The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights from a real-world dataset using statistical methods and visualizations.

The Titanic dataset from Kaggle was used to explore data distributions, identify missing values, detect outliers, and uncover relationships between variables.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Dataset overview and feature types
- Missing value analysis and heatmaps
- Distribution plots (Age, Fare)
- Outlier detection using box plots
- Correlation heatmap for numeric variables
- Categorical comparisons (Survival by Gender, Class, Port)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `assignment4_eda_titanic.ipynb` – Python notebook with full EDA code and visualizations  
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis  
- `plots/` – Folder containing saved plots (optional)
- `README.md` – Overview and documentation for Week 4

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- Histograms and KDE plots
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Count plots for category distributions
- Heatmap for correlation analysis

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 'Cabin' has the highest number of missing values
- Majority of passengers were aged between 20–40
- Outliers were present in 'Fare' values, with some exceeding $500
- Females and 1st class passengers had a higher survival rate
- Positive correlation observed between Fare and Survival
- Embarkation port 'C' had the highest survival ratio

## 🧠 Reflection

This EDA helped me understand how to clean, explore, and visualize data effectively using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I also learned how to derive actionable insights from data and prepare it for future modeling tasks.
